If we were to describe in one word, our experience with Ara, for our son Arjun, it will be <b>‘Transformative’!!</b><br><br>

Our son was keen to go beyond the conventional rat race of JEE etc, but was struggling to figure out the landscape of institutions that would act like a good springboard for his professional career. <br><br>

To address this fundamental need, Ara has a robust process, which begins with a deep understanding of the streams that our son wanted to pursue. It culminated in a shortlist of the best reputed institutions both in India & abroad for the chosen streams. This gave enormous clarity to our son. Then began the process of Profile/CV creation, Essay & Interview preparation. <br><br>

We soon realized that each college has a different operating philosophy, that permeates into their application & admission process. The Ara team understands this very well. Consequently they set a tailored regimen, setting a gruelling pace for our son to build his profile and to prepare for the interviews based on each different college.
Throughout this process, they struck the right balance of encouragement & critique. It helped our son to appreciate his inherent potential and also become aware of his areas of improvement. <br><br>

A disciplined weekly routine with regular touchpoints to track progress was set. Monthly parent meetings helped us keep pace with the entire admission process. This process of Ara which in our opinion is akin to plucking a rough stone and polishing it into a shining gem has yielded results far beyond what we had thought a few months ago. <br><br>

Today our son has got offers from some of the best ranked universities across India, Europe, Canada & Australia. Full credit to Ara for helping us navigate through a very critical phase of our lives as parents - that of setting our children on the best possible path for their higher education. <br><br>

We hope that many more parents and students are able to benefit from Ara in their quest for finding a differentiated career path.

<span class="review" style="color: #ffffff"><br>
My experience with Ara was extremely positive and compared to my friends who went to other counsellors, very different too!<br><br> 

Interacting with Ara on a regular basis helped to guide my thoughts. Having participated in a bunch of extracurriculars at school, they helped me choose the right balance to use in my resume. They also were extremely rigorous with my essays and interviews and made sure that the quality never dropped.<br><br>

Those hours they made sure I put in helped me make those split-second decisions during on-the-spot essays and interviews which contributed hugely towards me getting admissions.<br><br>

Their philosophy of doing all the hard work early and then reaping the rewards later made sure that I had all of my admissions before I had even started my pre-boards! Their way of interacting with me and shaping my thought process for my college and work life was brilliant. They made the very daunting college admissions process look like a breeze! In hindsight, it was the perfect decision to choose Ara.

College admissions being an important part in the furtherance of education and shaping future goals, we were on the lookout for advisors for our son Shounak. We interacted with a few education counsellors before we came across Ara. Since the very first interaction with Ara, the experience was stimulating, and comforting – be it their approach, their in-depth knowledge and insights, their analyses of the strength of the student, future goals and well-thought-out advice. They expertly took us through the myriad choices available and helped us to zero down on a few definite choices which we would like to pursue.<br><br>

During the handholding part of the application process – Ara insisted on personally checking each and every application before the final submission.  Ara had a disciplined approach for each application and critically reviewed each part of the applications.  Also, because of Ara's detailed coaching, the quality of essays that our son wrote improved drastically.  The personal coaching for tests and interviews, the rigour to touch upon each and every small aspect were really impressive.<br><br>

Today our son stands with offers from some of the top-ranked universities across the world and we are in a situation of having to choose from among the best!

<span class="review" style="color: #ffffff"><br>
I was a bit apprehensive about engaging a counselor for my college admissions.   I feared that counselors would tell my parents what my parents wanted to hear rather than taking my preferences into account. My experience with Ara has been nothing but the complete opposite!<br><br>

Since the beginning of my engagements with Ara,  their entire focus was on my future...it was about my choices, interests and preferences.  Every single concern that I had was addressed to my satisfaction.  Ara was very patient with me and gave real-life, practical advice.<br><br>

Ara maintained regular and frequent contact with me; coaching me and helping me with various exercises to improve my essay writing skills.  This helped make my application distinctive vis-a-vis my peer group. Through multiple intense sessions of simulated interviews, Ara provided detailed guidance and practice on managing interviews, what to expect, how to respond and turn the interview to my benefit.  Hence, when the actual interviews happened, it was like a walk in the park for me!<br><br>

If you are considering applying to competitive colleges in India and outside, I would strongly recommend Ara, to give you that extra edge.

I was caught in a lot of self-doubt and confusion in order to decide which colleges I should apply for. After the very first meeting with Ara, I felt at ease and very comfortable. We had daily video calls to discuss the application filling process and it was a meeting that inspired me a to do better and change the habits I was living with for many years. <br><br>

The one thing I liked about Ara the most is that they never sugarcoated anything for me. They have been brutally honest with me throughout this journey…which was necessary to make me work harder and get admissions I had always wanted! I developed an extremely friendly bond with Ara’s leadership, and used to look forward to our video calls the entire week. I remember the seriousness and strictness Ara displayed at times but it never made me feel bad as it always left me feeling more motivated than ever before. Time was just a number for Ara as they made sure that they stayed on the call till the time our daily goal was achieved, no matter how much time it took. Ara prepared me for my interviews and grilled me in the mocks that they conducted. <br><br>

Overall, it was a great learning experience as Ara would coach me about small but very valuable tips for cracking admissions. Interviews were always something that made me nervous at first but now it’s a different story all thanks to Ara. All in all, my experience with Ara was simply outstanding. Words aren’t enough to describe the experience I have had and the bond I have shared with Ara’s leadership.

…we came across many Admissions consultants/counselors…most of them more or less offered the same services… which lacked personal touch which we think is very crucial...
<br><br>
As parents, we highly recommend Ara because they don’t just deal with counseling, form filling and timely submissions… 

<!--<font color=#ffffff>--> their personalized and intensive coaching<!--</font>-->
for our daughter Kashmira 
<!--<font color=#ffffff>--> on critical skills such as Writing and Interview Preparation<!--</font>-->

made their services stand out…

<br><br>

<!--<font color=#ffffff>-->
Ara helped Kashmira’s transition to become a strong story-teller through her essays and a confident interviewee…

Another positive with Ara has been their pre-emptive and prompt end-to-end services… There was never a need to follow-up with them…

Ara made Kashmira’s Admissions process easy, hassle-free and enjoyable…

We appreciate the scientific and logical approach that Ara has, which got Agasstya’s selection in the multiple colleges, and admitted to one of the finest business schools in India.<br><br>

Ara has been one of the best choices we made. We are really
impressed with the personal attention that was given to our son
during the entire admission process, right from listing the colleges
to the admission procedure. The direction and valuable guidance
by Ara has been one of the key factors in achieving goals of
studying in one of the best universities.<br><br>

Ara has helped my son achieve his goals and has always been
there at every step of the way in order to guide our son. I would
recommend Ara to any aspirants looking forward to study in their
dream universities.

…the college admission process is arduous. It involves selecting the right universities, years of profile building, financial considerations, essay writing, articulation of extra-curriculars and the like. A professional Counselor makes this roller coaster ride smooth and easy.<br><br>



<!--<font color=#ed5f2f>-->
Ara has guided me and my family through every step of this journey. With their support, my son Arnav gained acceptance from 10+ global universities such as UMass Amherst, HKUST, University of Manchester, University of Toronto and University of Waterloo.<br><br>
<!--</font>-->

<!--<font color=#000000>-->
Although most counselors consider the ‘process’ to be over at that point,
<!--</font>-->

<!--<font color=#ed5f2f>--> Ara coached us on factors to consider while accepting an admission, thus choose between colleges.
Ara has played an instrumental role in my son’s admissions and guided us through every step of the extremely complicated process…

We were introduced to Ara by a reference in 2020. Although they were not many years in the field of counselling, speaking with them instilled confidence in us that we have our child’s interest and career in safe hands.
<br><br>

Ara has been there with us since day one and hand held us through the entire process of submission of forms/preparation of interviews/guiding in essays writing and other minute details. Oftentimes, they have been more concerned about the admissions process than us!
<br><br>

In fact, we have developed a strong personal bond with the founders of Ara, who are more friends than Counsellors now!
